Title: malaria.py
Date: 2020-10-09
Author: VirÃ¡g Varga

Description:
	This program uses the malaria.fna FASTA file and the malaria.blastx.tab file containing
		gene prodoct functions in order add those functions into the header lines
		of the FASTA sequences.
	The program exludes sequences with no assigned functions from the final output.
	The script as written is limited to use with input files malaria.fna and malaria.blastx.tab;
		and an output file output.txt.

List of functions:
	No user-defined functions are used in the process.

List of "non standard" modules:
	No non-standard modules were used.

Procedure:
	1. A dictionary consisting of the sequence identifiers and the associated functions
		is built from the malaria.blastx.tab file.
	2. A dictionary consisting of the sequence headers and the associated gene sequences
		is built from the malaria.fna file.
	3. An output file is constructed wherein the identified functions of the gene products
		are added to the sequence headers from the FASTA file. Genes with functions
		listed as 'null' in the malaria.blastx.tab file are exluded from this output.

Usage:
	./malaria.py malaria.fna malaria.blastx.tab output.txt
	OR
	python malaria.py malaria.fna malaria.blastx.tab output.txt

This script was written for Python 3.8.5, in Spyder 4.

	if name_dict[seq_name2] != 'null':
		#uses the newly created variable seq_name2 as the key in the name_dict dictionary
		#checks to see whether the called value is 'null', and excludes such results from further commands
		output.write('>' + seq_header + '\t' + name_dict[seq_name2] + '\n')
		#writes the sequence header with the > character at the start, the original header, and the protein function at the end
		#also includes a '\n' character so that the next command will write into a new line
		output.write(fasta_dict[seq_header] + '\n')
		#writes out the sequence associated with the sequence header called and written in the command above
		#also includes a '\n' character so that the next command will write into a new line
